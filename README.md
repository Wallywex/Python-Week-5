OOP Demonstration Programs
Overview

This repository contains two Python programs designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

Library System – Shows classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism using books and eBooks.

Vehicle Polymorphism – Shows polymorphism with multiple vehicle types, each implementing the same action (move()) differently.

Features
Library System

Create Books and EBooks with attributes like title, author, pages, and file size.

Display book information using show_info().

Read books using read(), demonstrating method overriding in child classes.

Vehicle Polymorphism

Create multiple vehicle types: Car, Plane, Boat, etc.

Each vehicle implements the move() method differently:

Car → “Driving 🚗”

Plane → “Flying ✈️”

Boat → “Sailing ⛴️”

Demonstrates polymorphism by using a common interface (move()) for all vehicles.
